# it's all about timing

The installation "pacefaker" consists of two Arduino Nano 33 IoT boards of which one is hooked up to a Sparkfun BioSensor for pulse measurement, while the other one sits inside a silicon-casted human heart to power to mimic the measured heart beat. Commuication between the boards is realised with BLE and built up upon sample code by Jeremy Ellis:

Handling the BioSensor is based on sample code by Elias Santistevan, Sparkfun Electronics:

In a first step, the BLE setup is tested by connecting the sensor unit to a website (works best in Chrome).

The interactive installation was presented in February 2023 at Muthesius Kunsthochschule, Kiel, Germany.
